Main libraries: 

Pytorch
Tensorflow 

Projects: 

1. Iris Dataset -> done!
2. 

Mastery Strategy 1 

Implementing Research Paper From Scratch --> 1 New Paper a Month, Research Papers:

1. Attention is all you need
2. YOLO: you only look once
3. A few useful things to know about machine learning 
4. Bag of tricks for image classification with convolutional neural networks
5. Distilling the knowledge in a neural network 

Mastery Strategy 2 
Fine Tuning an Open Source LLM with Google Colab --> TBD.
