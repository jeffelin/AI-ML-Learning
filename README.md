# ML Projects To Do 

I am working on learning and applying AI programs. Most of the work here is open sourced and done with the help of prev. creators. I played with a lot of the programs. All credits are attached within specific applications. 

Suggestions can be sent to jefflincreates@gmail.com

## Main Techniques

Linear Regression, Classification, Neural Network 

## Main libraries

- ML: Pytorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn 
- Deployment: Streamlit
- General: Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Yfinance 

### Projects -> need to play around more 

1. Iris Dataset -> :white_check_mark:
2. Stock Price App -> :white_check_mark:
3. DNA Counter App -> :white_check_mark: 
4. S&P500 Data Scraping -> :white_check_mark:

### Brainstorming
- Streamlit PDF 
- AI Tutor aka Goggins (Colab, API, Streamlit)
- Content Creator 
- Auotmated Content (MidJourney, Dalle)
- Summary AI (text, audio, video)
- Jeff GPT 

#### Mastery Strategy 1 

Implementing Research Paper From Scratch --> 1 New Paper a Month, Research Papers:

1. Attention is all you need
2. YOLO: you only look once
3. A few useful things to know about machine learning 
4. Bag of tricks for image classification with convolutional neural networks
5. Distilling the knowledge in a neural network 

#### Mastery Strategy 2 
Fine Tuning an Open Source LLM with Google Colab --> TBD.
